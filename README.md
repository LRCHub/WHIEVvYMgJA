[00:00.32] I just hope that someday, someone would love me
[00:23.82] 
[00:04.32] There's no hellos
[00:07.46] On our way to the show
[00:10.76] Your sweet face is turning cold
[00:14.55] As the fires begin to draw a little closer
[00:35.55] 
[00:18.61] I left all the water running at home (oh, shit)
[00:21.87] Then drove around with a car that we stole
[00:25.42] All of a sudden, they just wanted to know
[00:28.79] How I really feel
[00:37.29] 
[00:30.83] So I just danced
[00:35.32] Feel you
[00:38.87] Feel you
[00:42.29] Feel you
[00:46.29] 
[00:44.90] I just danced (feel you)
[00:49.11] Feel you
[00:52.62] Feel you
[00:56.62] 
[00:59.82] Hello
[01:01.20] Your beautiful roses are flat
[01:03.39] Flamingos
[01:04.46] Are turning into giant pink rats
[01:06.76] Let me know
[01:07.54] How many knives are in my back
[01:10.01] Don't get cold
[01:11.27] Your world is just about to crack
[01:27.77] 
[01:13.81] I left all the water running at home
[01:16.82] Then drove around with a car that we stole
[01:20.44] All of a sudden, they just wanted to know
[01:23.44] How I really feel
[01:31.94] 
[01:25.71] So I just danced
[01:30.45] Feel you
[01:33.88] Feel you
[01:37.23] Feel you
[01:41.23] 
[01:40.06] I just danced (feel you)
[01:44.15] Feel you
[01:47.69] Feel you
[01:51.69] 
[01:55.92] I never thought it would come to this (woo-woo-woo)
[01:59.56] What, you like them struggles? (Huh)
[02:03.27] It's not your end of the story
[02:06.45] God, this shit sucks
[02:07.76] MITO (huh)
[02:12.76] 
[02:18.00] I'm going
[02:22.50] 
[02:22.17] I left all the water running at home
[02:25.43] Then drove around with a car that we stole
[02:28.80] All of a sudden, they just wanted to know
[02:32.07] This is how I really feel
[02:44.57] 
[02:45.45] This is how I really feel
[02:47.82] So I just danced
